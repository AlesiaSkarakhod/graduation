# Graduation
Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) without frontend.

The task is:

Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.

 - 2 types of users: admin and regular users
 - Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
 - Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
 - Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
 - Only one vote counted per user
 - If user votes again the same day:
 -If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
 - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
Each restaurant provides new menu each day.

As a result, provide a link to github repository. It should contain the code, README.md with API documentation and couple curl commands to test it.
